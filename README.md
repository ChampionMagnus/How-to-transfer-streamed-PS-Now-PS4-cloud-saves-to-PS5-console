Instructions for How to transfer streamed PS Now PS4 cloud saves to PS5 console

This text guide and the video guide will assist you in being able to transfer a previously played and saved game you played for the PS4 via streaming it while on your PS5 (PS Now). You have now installed the game (not playing it via cloud streaming) and upon loading, you do not have your prior save files. You will need to properly retrieve them from the cloud as detailed in this guide and video and make sure the new game you created is now overwritten (if you have already tried to play the game installed on console only to find the save is not there) and replaced with the original save you were using when you were playing it via cloud streaming. This will all be covered in the guide and the video. Following this guiode will allow you to pick up and continue where you left off when you were playinging the game via streaming before you downloaded and installed the game to the PS5 console, and you will not lose all your saved game progress or need to start all over again.
